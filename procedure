How to do the deconvolution of the .asc datasets produced with the HEKA SECM.


1, Multiplying X-ccordinate and current to get micrometer and picoampere.
   
   awk '{$1, print $2*1000000, $3*1000000000000}' 140128_1E1_11_3D.asc > 140128_1E1_11_3D_.asc
   This is a linux bash tool, of course it can be done with Origin or Excel.

2, Correct chronology of the measurement, by mirroring every other scanline
   
   Original data is in a format like this:

	scanline 1:
        0
	2
	4
	...
	50

	scanline 2:
	0
	2
	4
	...
	50

   But this is not the chronological order for the meander. The second scanline starts with the X-ccordinate 50!
   Correct order of the dataset
